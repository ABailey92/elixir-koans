It is a tour\r\nof the most important features and idiomatic usage of the language.\r\n\r\n### Installing Elixir\r\nElixir runs on the Erlang VM, so to get started with the koans you need to install both Erlang and Elixir. The official Elixir webpage has [instructions](http://elixir-lang.org/install.html) for how to do this.\r\n\r\n### Installing Inotify\r\nIf you're on a Mac, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nTo provide the best experience, koans are run automatically when you save a file. This is accomplished with a tool called `inotify` which needs to be installed separately if you're not using OSX. Linux users will need to install `inotify-tools` ([guides](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/wiki)), and Windows users need `inotify-win` ([guides](https://github.com/thekid/inotify-win)).\r\n\r\n### Getting the koans\r\n\r\nThe next step is to get the source code of the koans so that you can run it. Assuming that you have git installed, it's as simple as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans\r\n$ cd elixir-koans\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the source code pulled, you'll also need to fetch the dependencies for this project:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mix deps.get\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running the koans\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to run the koans! On your command line, type:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ mix meditate\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see that the first koan has failed in `lib/koans/01_equalities.ex`. Open that file, and change the first koan to make the assertion true. After successfully passing the koan, you should see the next failure.\r\n\r\n### Repeat\r\n\r\nKeep making changes to satisfy the assertions in the code. When you've finished the first file, the runner will automatically run the next file until there are no more koans.\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n\r\nWe'd like to thank all our [contributors](https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans/graphs/contributors).\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions, feel free to [open an issue or a pull request](https://github.com/elixirkoans/elixir-koans)",
